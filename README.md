# Project Amayo

In honour of Amayo Mordecai, we are consolidating as much learning resources in the University of Nairobi School of Health, as possible.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Python Virtual Environment, virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
- [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/install/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://docs.postgresql.org) and [psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/)
- Any other dependencies listed in requirements.txt

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Clone the repository using

`git clone https://github.com/amsuncode/project-amayo.git`

OR

 `git clone git@github.com:amsuncode/project-amayo.git` if using SSH

2. You need to activate a virtual environment for the project, and every other time you want to make changes

 Here, [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) is included with python.

 Start with `python3 -m venv [replace with what you would like to call the virtual environment]`. You can do `python3 -m venv amayo`

 Activate virtual environment using what you call your virtual environment. Ours was `amayo`

`source amayo/bin/activate`

 Then install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 
 If you are using Windows and encounter an error, then try the below process:
 Go to the terminal - Step 1:
 `pip3 install -U pip virtualenv`
 Step 2:
 `virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python ./venv`
 or
 `virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 ./venv`
 Step 3:
 `.\venv\activate`
 

3. Run migrations

`python manage.py makemigrations`

`python manage.py migrate`

4. Run the server, inside `project-amayo/amayo/`

`python manage.py runserver`

The server will be running on <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>

## Running the tests

We will update this part once we start writing tests for the code

`python manage.py test`

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
